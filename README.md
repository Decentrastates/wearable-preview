# Wearable Preview

This webapp receives a `contract` address and either an `item` or a `token` ids via query params and it renders an interactive preview of it with the appropiate rarity gradient as background.

Example: https://wearable-preview.decentraland.org?contract=0xee8ae4c668edd43b34b98934d6d2ff82e41e6488&item=5
